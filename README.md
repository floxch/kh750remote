# kh750remote
Neumann KH 750 DSP remote control with Contour ShuttleXpress using Node.js

You need the following npm packages (npm install):
node-osc
node-hid
node-notifier
multicast-dns

This is in every case work in progress! I have no idea about how to write or use Node.js or even Javascript.
Neither do I know how to handle modified npm packages, which is why you find a modified file included. I hope you can do a git revert after using npm install.

There are many things left to do and to improve, please feel free to help.

For the moment, if you use this, please make sure there are no other devices supporting Sennheiser Sound Control in your network besides one KH 750.
